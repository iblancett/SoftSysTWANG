### Twang - a Lisp interpreter in C
#### Emily Lepert and Isa Blancett

The goal of this project is to create our own LISP interpreter in C. Our MVP would be to complete a basic Lisp interpreter that can process logical statements, loops, functions, and variable definitions. Our stretch goal is to implement literal lists and perhaps string operators.

Isa wants to work on a collaborative project and learn how to build a C program from the bottom up instead of adapting existing projects.
Emily's learning goal is to get more familiar with C.

To get started we found a couple tutorials on basic Lisp interpreters. We also found an example of an open source Lisp interpreter project that we are getting ideas for our interpreter (in terms of what to implement).

Isa is working on implementing the mathematical functionality (+, -,/,*) and comparative operators. Emily is working on implementing loops, conditionals, and equivalence test operators. When we finish those, we will then implement function definitions together. We will be successful if we can run a basic Lisp Shell with the mentioned functionality.

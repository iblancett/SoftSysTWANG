### Twang - a Lisp interpreter in C
#### Emily Lepert and Isa Blancett

The goal of this project is to create our own basic LISP interpreter in C. Our interpreter has the ability to take in mathematical and conditional LISP commands, interpret them in C, and output the appropriate result.

Our learning goals is to get more familiar with C.

To get started we found a couple tutorials on basic Lisp interpreters. We also found an example of an [open source Lisp interpreter project](https://github.com/rui314/minilisp) which we used to figure out what we wanted to implement.

We were able to implement mathematical functionality (adding, subtracting, dividing, multiplying) and comparative operators (<, =). We were also able to interpret conditionals that used mathematical statements. We also added a test suite for our functions.

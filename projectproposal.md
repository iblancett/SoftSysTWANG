### Twang - a Lisp based programming language
#### Emily Lepert and Isa Blancett

The goal of this project is to create our own programming language modeled after Lisp. Our MVP would be to complete a basic Lisp tutorial and add functionality. Our stretch goal would be to either also write a different language from scratch or adapt the one we've already written independently of the Lisp tutorial.

Isa wants to work on a collaborative project and learn how to build a C program from the bottom up instead of adapting existing projects.
Emily's learning goal is to get more familiar with C.

To get started we need to find a Lisp tutorial. We have several and just need to narrow down on one or two to follow. We also want to explore other small programming languages for inspiration.

Our first steps will be to select which tutorial we want to accomplish. Then we will complete the Lisp tutorial we select. Both team members will complete this tutorial. After that we would adapt the Lisp tutorial to create our own language.
